Title: How to use AWS? How to teach speech?
Date: 1st June 2017

Thanks to speakers today Austin and Michael, and thank you to all those attending...special thanks to Jennifer for the treats.

## June 1st meetup

Austin took us through session 1 and the trials and tribulations of setting up AWS. We discussed how to divide up data into test train and validate and data folders. Then moved onto discuss the idea transfer learning or using a network trained on one set of data to classify another set of data, in our case cats and dogs.

In session 2 Michael took us through some very cool code he had written for phoneme to grapheme translation showing interesting results. After asking why? We discussed modification to the network via embeddings, BiLSTM and attention, convolutional variants, Differentiable Neural Computers (because) and mixed length filters in conv nets.

## Next week
Session 1 will be a group help out lesson for getting some of our new members people started onto the Fast AI course.
Session 2 will be a discussion on attention and embedding. Michael will be running through some material on embedding while Sean tackles attention.

See you next week
