Title: Applying Embeddings to DNA KMer Matching
Date: 22nd June 2017

This week we began with code from the fast.ai course in the beginners
session (6-7).  In the advanced session (7-8) we listened to an actual
bio-informatics guru Phillipp Bayer talking about applying embeddings
to DNA kmer matching as inspired by Mike's talk last week.

[This is the wonderful article on using arithmetic similar to word2vec to compare (hate-)subreddits](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dissecting-trumps-most-rabid-online-following/)
(could be interesting to do this with DNA from different plants to see what falls out)

You can apply for access if you have an Australian Access Federation (AAF) account, i.e., if you work for CSIRO or any Australian research institute.

Here in Perth there's [Pawsey Centre](https://www.pawsey.org.au/2016/09/applications-now-open-2017-access-to-pawsey-supercomputers/):
Looks like you need to be part of an Australian research institute as well to be eligible.
