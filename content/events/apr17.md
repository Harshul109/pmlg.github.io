Title: RNN's and Jupyter Notebook Hints
Date: 2017-04-27


This week in the beginner session we explored some tips and tricks for
getting the most out of Jupyter Notebook. We also looked at how to
answer the question, "what libraries are even installed".

In the advanced hour we continued our exploration of RNN's. We
examined how you can produce a sequence of outputs from an RNN and
discussed how the keras implementation of RNN's works. Next week we
will go through LSTM's.
