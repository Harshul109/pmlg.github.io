Title: Lesson 7 and Group Poll
Date: 11th May 2017

Last week we had a great turn out, with 15 people attending. In the
beginner session we explored the basics of CNN's as well as looking
into the implementation of VGG from
the [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai) course. While in the advanced
session we finally finished RNN's.
