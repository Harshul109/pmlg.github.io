Title: Deep Networks for Financial Markets
Date: 18th of May

Last week we heard from Sarada on her tips for how to get started with
deep learning and getting the most out of the fast.ai course. That was
followed by Darcy who explored using a Seq2Seq model for fungal gene sequencing.

This week we looked at financial modelling, being led by Shereif. He has produced this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/pmlg/notebooks/blob/master/IndicatorsNN.ipynb), and led us through his thinking. Pull requests welcome!
