Title: Next Deep Learning Meeting

Hi Perth Deep Learners,

We've changed the format. Instead of going through each lecture from
the mooc, we are splitting our time into two slots, a beginner
session, from 6-7pm, and an advanced session from 7-8pm.

If you are a beginner and haven't been following the course, please
come to the beginner session, we will happily go over the basics and
help you come up to speed. No homework required!

For the advanced session, it will be a discussion group around some
advanced topics. Last week we:
- Explored an application of Deep Learning in Biology lead by Darcy
- Learnt more about what you actually get when you ask for a p2.xlarge
instance from amazon.
- Explored what a de-convolution means.
- Explored what an embedding means in a biology domain.

In this weeks advanced session I'll start by giving a walk through
lesson 6 on RNN's and LSTM's as well as give a quick overview of my
experience dabbling with Tensorflow.
